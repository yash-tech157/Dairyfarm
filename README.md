# Dairy Farm Management System

This is a backend application for managing a dairy farm. It provides a RESTful API to handle animal records, including their health status, milk production, and medical history. The application is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

- **Animal Management**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for animal records.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all incoming data conforms to a strict schema.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses Mongoose for seamless interaction with a MongoDB database.
- **RESTful API**: Clean and well-structured API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool.
- **Cors**: A Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Dotenv**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
